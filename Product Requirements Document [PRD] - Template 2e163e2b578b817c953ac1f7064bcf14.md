## How to Use The Template?

## 🧑‍🎓 For APMs / First-Time PMs

> ✅ Goal: Learn to think in structure and drive clarity, even if you don’t know all the answers yet.
> 

| Step | Action | Why it Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Duplicate the Template** | Make a copy of the PRD for your initiative | Keeps your work standardized; avoids reinventing structure |
| **2. Fill the Header Block** | Add Title, POC info, Date, etc. | Sets context for stakeholders who read this later |
| **3. Start with the “Why (Objective)”** | Ask your manager or lead: *"What business/user outcome are we solving for?"* | This prevents you from chasing solutions without understanding the problem |
| **4. Define ‘Success’** | Draft OKRs, metrics, and guardrails | Even rough guesses force you to think outcomes, not just features |
| **5. Describe the Users** | Create 1–2 personas, write their problem in JTBD format | Learn structured user empathy and map problem-solution fit |
| **6. Talk to 2-3 stakeholders** | Ask Tech/Design: *“What’s missing in this PRD so far?”* | You’ll catch early gaps and improve your velocity |
| **7. Write the ‘Solution’ briefly** | Just outline your idea, and mention alternatives you ruled out | Keeps thinking visible. Your lead will help you refine it |
| **8. Add wireframes/mockups** | Use FigJam/Figma + link it in “Product Flow” section | A picture makes edge cases and flows visible |
| **9. List edge cases explicitly** | Think: what could break? what’s unexpected? | Builds strong product instincts early on |
| **10. Tentative Timeline + Dependencies** | Add basic assumptions even if not final | Helps others plan and shows initiative |

## 🧑‍💼 For Mid-Level PMs

> ✅ Goal: Own the full lifecycle from ambiguity to sprint clarity with full stakeholder alignment.

### 🧠 Step-by-Step PM Guide:

| Step | Action | Pro Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Kickoff with Discovery** | Interview users / analyze data / review support tickets | Use this to fill “Who are the users” + “Problems we are solving” |
| **2. Write the “Why” + OKRs** | Anchor the doc in measurable goals | Tie this section directly to quarterly team OKRs |
| **3. Get Alignment on the ‘Problem’ Before ‘Solution’** | Circulate the draft up to “How do we measure success?” | Prevents premature debates on implementation |
| **4. Map Alternatives + Trade-offs** | In the “Solution” section, list considered paths | Helps stakeholders trust your judgment |
| **5. Create the Product Flow** | Add: journey map, wireframes, stories, edge cases | Make it visual and detailed — saves time downstream |
| **6. Write Acceptance Criteria** | For every user story, define “done” clearly | This improves engineering velocity and avoids ping-pong |
| **7. Assign Tentative Dates** | Even if rough — show when Beta could be live | Triggers roadmap planning and expectation-setting |
| **8. Flag Dependencies** | List budget, infra, APIs, and team blockers | Keep leadership and eng leads looped in early |
| **9. Add Event Tracking Plan** | Define what analytics will prove impact | Ask: *“What events do we need to validate success?”* |
| **10. Share → Collect Feedback → Iterate** | Share async before any review meeting | Turn PRD into a **shared decision artifact**, not a private plan |

### 💼 Notes:

- **Link to Loom: walkthroughs** inside the document to explain the complexity.
- **Push upstream clarity**: Make your PRD the reason people cancel alignment meetings.
- **Own end-to-end**: From PRD → Tickets → QA checklist → Launch → Post-launch metrics.
